# TYPO3 Extension ``md_fullcalendar``
 
This extension brings the Javascript [FullCalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/) with switchable views for month, week and day to [ext:calendarize](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/calendarize/). It is also possible to filter calendars by categories.

In comparison to the Fullcalendar view of ext:calendarize, the shipped plugin of this extension loads the events in the background according to the selected view of the calendar. So you can switch between the month-, week- and day view without reloading the page.

If you use the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework in you project, the detail view of an event is opened in a modal window.
